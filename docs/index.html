        <h3>going to sameer hill</h3>
        <p>this trek was a hell lot
             emotional ride. my wingies randomly asked me tag along at 1pm, just 4 hrs prior going. 
            i technically didn't slept that day! it was first
             going for all of us and it was pitch dark. funny part is, that a drunkard lead our way to top.
            i still don't understand how and why we trusted him. but it was all worth-doing, to see the sunrise
            of that day. it was <del> scary</del> amazing experience with breathtaking view </p>

        <h3>marine drive</h3>
        <p>first time going out with wingies. we went on new years' day!
            it was sunday, so there was a megablock. taking a cab was too expensive,
            so we just decided to go with local. for we needed to go mulund, so we got on a bus. 
            on reaching the station, we found a train going to csmt. till we go to platform, it started moving.
            so we got on a moving train. this was my first time doing such train, it was terrifing but 
            yet thrilling too. overall had fun, even didn't explore much! 
            watching sunset on marine drive was the best part ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
